# Workspace

## Overview

pnpm workspace monorepo using TypeScript. Each package manages its own dependencies.

## Stack

- **Monorepo tool**: pnpm workspaces
- **Node.js version**: 24
- **Package manager**: pnpm
- **TypeScript version**: 5.9
- **API framework**: Express 5
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Validation**: Zod (`zod/v4`), `drizzle-zod`
- **API codegen**: Orval (from OpenAPI spec)
- **Build**: esbuild (CJS bundle)

## Key Commands

- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen` — regenerate API hooks and Zod schemas from OpenAPI spec
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push` — push DB schema changes (dev only)
- `pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev` — run API server locally

## Onichan Bot — Custodial Wallet (src/)

The Telegram bot in `src/` runs alongside the workspace. Its custodial wallet:

- **`src/modules/chain_config.py`** — single source of truth for supported chains
  (label, address regex, RPC, explorer URL templates) and assets (native + USDT/USDC
  variants). Exposes `parse_recipient(raw, asset, chain_hint)` that classifies a
  free-form input into Telegram id / username / on-chain address (with `candidates`
  for ambiguous EVM addresses) and `to_frontend_json()` for the wallet UI.
- **`src/modules/onchain_broadcaster.py`** — signs & broadcasts withdrawals.
  EVM (eth_account + JSON-RPC `eth_sendRawTransaction`) handles native + ERC-20
  transfers; Tron (tronpy) handles native TRX + TRC-20. SOL/TON/BTC fall through
  to manual `/confirmwd` until their broadcasters are wired up. The hot wallet
  uses HD derivation index `0`; user deposit addresses start at `1`.
- **Withdraw flow** — `/api/wallet/withdraw` (and `/withdraw` bot command) accept a
  smart `recipient` (username / Telegram id / wallet address). Internal recipients
  are paid atomically inside `_wallet_txn()`. On-chain recipients debit the user
  and insert a `pending` row in `wallet_transactions`, then move through a
  three-stage state machine driven by `_withdrawal_worker`:
  - `pending → broadcasting` — claimed atomically with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`.
    Token-balance precheck (`_evm_erc20_balance_of` / TRC-20 `balanceOf`) avoids
    burning gas on guaranteed-revert transfers.
  - `broadcasting → broadcast` — tx accepted by mempool, `tx_hash` recorded; user
    DMed "📡 Broadcast — waiting for confirmation".
  - `broadcast → confirmed | failed` — receipt poll (`get_receipt_status`) flips
    to `confirmed` on success or `failed` + atomic refund on revert.
  Crash recovery: on startup any `broadcasting` row with `tx_hash IS NULL` is
  swept back to `pending`. `/rejectwd` and the `wdrej:` callback only act on
  `pending`/`broadcasting` rows — never `broadcast` — so a live mempool tx can
  never be double-credited. Soft failures (`insufficient_hot_balance`,
  `hd_unavailable`) park back to `pending` and ping the owner.
- **Explorer links** — every deposit/withdrawal DM and history row renders a 🔍
  link built from `chain_config.explorer_tx_url` / `explorer_addr_url`.

## Onichan Marketplace (src/modules/marketplace.py + src/market_routes.py)

Peer-to-peer digital product marketplace integrated into the web panel.

- **DB tables**: `market_listings`, `market_bids`, `market_purchases`, `market_reviews`, `market_settings`
- **Listing types**: Fixed-price (instant buy) and Auction (with bid holding/refund)
- **Credits escrow**: Bid amounts held via `deduct_credits`, refunded when outbid; seller payout via `add_credits` after confirm
- **Auto-confirm**: Background thread (`start_background_thread`) releases seller payouts after 24h and finalizes expired auctions
- **Commission**: Configurable % taken from seller payout, stored in `market_settings`
- **Notifications**: Telegram DM to buyer/seller on new bid, outbid, sale, auction won, payout
- **Routes registered**: `/user/market`, `/user/market/listing/<id>`, `/user/market/sell`, `/user/market/myshop`, `/user/market/myorders`, `/user/market/download/<token>`, plus API endpoints at `/user/market/api/*` and `/admin/market`
- **Product types**: Text content (shown in-browser) or file upload (served via `send_from_directory`)
- **Seller ratings**: 1–5 star reviews per confirmed purchase
- **Admin panel**: `/admin/market` — stats, commission rate control, listing removal
